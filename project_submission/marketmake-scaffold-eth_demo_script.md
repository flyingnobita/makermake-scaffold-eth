Hi everyone,

So unfortunately i don't have a finished project to present today.

When I joined the hackathon, I was hoping to meet a team of people to work on a project.

As a beginner in solidity, I was hoping that I can learn from the experienced solidity devs, while I contribute as a full-stack dev.

After the first week of the hackathon, I was still not able to find a team.  

So I changed my plan and decide use scaffold-eth and build a simple UI for Aave's flash loan or credit delegation.

I'm new to hardhat and ethers.js, so I thought this would be a good chance to learn about them.

After a day in while working on scaffold-eth, I found a bug that hanged my browser and I wasn't able to continue.

So I asked the scaffold-eth community and eventually the package's author, Austin, reached out to me. We chatted and I gave him my findings, which include logs and screen recordings.  

Soon enough, a fix was put in place, as you can see in this commit.

So while this isn't anything related to the MarketMake, it was probably one of the biggest contribution I made during this hackathon! 

Besides, I also learned a lot about Aave, hardhat and ethers.js.  

Looking forward to joining the next hackathon when I can submit a real project!  

Thank you for your time.
